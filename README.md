# Climate-Change-
Created dashboards in Tableau to study climate change
Class project completed Information Visualization class at San Jose State University.


- Worked collectively in a team of 3 to create dashboards in Tableau to study climate change, specifically droughts, global temperatures, CO2 emissions, glacier size, sea level.
- We conducted time series analysis and create geospatial data to examine how the changes in the environment have taken place over time and how it is different according to location. We also explored how all of these factors are interrelated like how rise in temperatures can cause an impact in melting of glaciers, increase in sea levels etc.
- I analyzed changes in drought conditions in US by creating a series of geomaps and overlay area charts in Tableau to demonstrate the changes in intensity and breadth of the droughts. The data was obtained from using geospatial data from U.S. Drought Monitor website.
- To explore trends in atmospheric Carbon Dioxide,  I created a time series graphs in Tableau which established seasonal and upwards trends in CO2  emissions in the past decades.
